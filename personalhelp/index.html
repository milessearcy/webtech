Creating the quiz helped me improve on my critical reading skills and <span style="color:green">develop a deeper understanding of the content we have been learning throughout the course. Before this assignment, I often approached readings and slides at a surface level. However, designing a quiz required me to think differently about the material. I needed to identify not only what was presented but also what was most significant, memorable, and likely to test a student’s comprehension. This process pushed me to actively engage with the lectures and primary sources in a way that encouraged deeper understanding.</span> Our overall goal as a group was to make a quiz that would not only test knowledge but also <span style="color:green">help quiz takers gain a stronger grasp of historical events and cultural differences during the time periods we studied in class. By preparing for the quiz, students would review content in a way that promoted both factual recall and critical thinking.</span>

For the design process, I relied heavily on the slide shows from weeks 1–4, as well as several of the primary sources <span style="color:orange">assigned during that time</span>. When creating questions, I focused mostly on what I felt should be the most memorable parts of each section. The questions that were the most difficult were <span style="color:green">the multiple-choice ones because it was challenging to come up with plausible incorrect answers. The wrong options needed to look realistic enough to make students think carefully, but not so misleading that they would confuse or frustrate them.</span>

Our group decided to split the questions into equal sections so each person had a manageable share of the work. Afterward, <span style="color:green">we reviewed the questions together, discussing improvements and clarifying wording to maintain consistency and appropriate difficulty.</span> Our main method of communication was a group chat, where we could message each other, <span style="color:green">which worked well because it allowed us to share ideas quickly and coordinate at our own convenience.</span>

The learning goal for our quiz was to test deeper understanding of the content <span style="color:green">while also helping students develop critical reading skills through the pre-test review. While many of our questions leaned toward factual recall, we also tried to phrase them in ways that required students to connect information rather than just memorize it. For example, some questions asked students to compare cultural practices or analyze causes and effects, which encouraged higher-level thinking.</span>

Since our group split the work equally among us, I don’t know the methods they used to make their questions. I decided to use AI to summarize information and point out key details that I may have missed <span style="color:green">and identify areas that required more attention. Importantly, I used AI as a supplement, not a replacement for my own thinking, which allowed me to enhance my understanding without compromising my learning process.</span>

In conclusion, designing the quiz helped me deepen my understanding of key concepts, important historical theories, and collaborating on projects. <span style="color:green">It also taught me how to responsibly integrate AI into my academic work, using it to support learning rather than to replace effort. Overall, this project demonstrated the importance of active engagement with course materials and thoughtful collaboration, both of which are essential for deeper learning and long-term academic growth.</span>
